SentinelShell is a command-line antivirus tool—streamlined for Windows and Termux—that scans, quarantines, and restores potentially malicious files using SHA-256 signature detection. Here’s how to wield it like a pro:

---

### 🔍 Basic Scan

To scan a directory without making changes:

```bash
python launcher.py C:/Path/To/Scan
```

In Termux:

```bash
python launcher.py /storage/emulated/0/Download
```

---

### 🛡️ Quarantine Mode

To scan and automatically isolate threats:

```bash
python launcher.py ./downloads --quarantine
```

Detected malware is moved to the `quarantine/` folder and logged in `quarantine_log.json`.

---

### ♻️ Restore a File

If you want to bring back a file that was falsely flagged:

```bash
python launcher.py --restore filename.exe
```

It will locate the original path from the log and move the file back.

---

### 🎧 Optional: Voice & Visual Vibe

- Add a custom `.wav` file at `assets/sentinel_greeting.wav`  
- Terminal will play the greeting and display Matrix-style splash on launch

---

### 🔐 Custom Malware Signatures

Edit `signatures/malware_db.json` and add SHA-256 hashes like:

```json
{
  "abc123...": "Trojan.Agent-Raw",
  "def456...": "Worm.ZeroCool"
}
```

You can generate a hash of any file like this:

```bash
python -c "import hashlib; print(hashlib.sha256(open('file.exe','rb').read()).hexdigest())"
```
